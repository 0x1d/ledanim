# Led animation library for ESP8266

- Has a nice webgui to select and SIMULATE led animations.
- Create web animations in javascript in your browser and submit them to your ESP8266 that has an actual ledstrip.
- Our goal is to create a huge library with animations.


For a demonstration look at: https://rawgit.com/psy0rz/ledanim/master/web/public_html/index.html

In future version the control-tab will control certiain variables of the animation.
